Will be Rust parser type thing not dissimilar to the [EM Parser]("https://github.com/Bardoctorus/EMparser") I made with some updates and with more Rust goodness

AS it stands however this is a bit of a playground for jsut learning a few Rust concepts. For example, I'm currently working on something that'll check the first letters of each word against a vector of letters, with the idea of counting them. For no reason at all.
