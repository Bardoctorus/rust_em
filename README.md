Will be Rust parser type thing not dissimilar to the [EM Parser]("https://github.com/Bardoctorus/EMparser") I made with some updates and with more Rust goodness

I had to nuke it all as it was lots of things, none of which were the parser. All of the code that was in it is now in the unforunately named text_anal project.
